# Maniz-Mag-App

ManizMag was built with Android Studio and Kotlin, delivering a dynamic, responsive UI. The interface is styled in XML and follows Material Design guidelines for a modern, intuitive user experience. Core features include viewing expenses and income, adding new entries, scanning QR codes, and an “About Me” page. The UI is optimized for multiple screen sizes and devices to ensure a consistent, pleasant experience.

On the backend, ManizMag uses a C# API that works with Firebase. Firebase handles user authentication as well as storage and management of expense and income data. The API bridges the frontend and backend and integrates with the tax authority to fetch receipt details from fiscal invoices scanned via QR. This setup enables secure, fast request processing and real-time delivery of relevant information.
